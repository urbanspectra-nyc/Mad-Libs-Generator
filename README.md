## Mad Libs Generator

![example](docs/media/images/app-demo-screenshot.png)

- This Simple Multilingual Mad Libs HTML Generator is supported here for public use.
  - As we type into the left-side text box, the two other text boxes display html text and browser previews, all generated on-the-fly.
  - Type the part of speech that should fill a blank field, wrapped by hard brackets, like so:
    ```
    [adjective]
    ```
  - Once we are ready, we can copy html source code from the middle column.
  - Then we can paste that html code into empty doc.html for further doc formatting, manually or auto-templating.
  - Look at the sample unformatted text [.txt file](catalog/test-content/test-content.txt) for further guidance.
  - Support is provided to those who wish to contribute to our catalog, as well as content translators.
