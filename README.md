## Mad Libs Generator

![example](demo-screenshot.png)

- This Simple Multilingual Mad Libs HTML Generator is supported here for public use.
  - As we type into the left-side text box, the two other text boxes display html text and browser previews, generated on-the-fly.
  - Type the part of speech it should be surrounded by hard brackets, like so:
    ```
    [adjective]
    ```
  - When we are ready, we copy html source code from the middle column, and then paste it to a doc.html for formatting.
  - Look at the sample .txt and .html files under .examples/jeremy-donson/ for further guidance.
  - We explore opportunities that clues provide for teaching and learning.
  - Templating will be useful here.
