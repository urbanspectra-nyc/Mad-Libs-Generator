## Mad Libs Generator

![example](app-demo-screenshot.png)

- This Simple Multilingual Mad Libs HTML Generator is supported here for public use.
  - As we type into the left-side text box, the two other text boxes display html text and browser previews, all generated on-the-fly.
  - Type the part of speech that should fill a blank field.  The part of speech should be surrounded by hard brackets, like so:
    ```
    [adjective]
    ```
  - When ready, we copy html source code from the middle column, and then paste it to a doc.html for formatting.
  - Look at the sample .txt and .html files under .examples/test-content/ for further guidance.
  - We provide support to those who wish to contribute to our catalog.
