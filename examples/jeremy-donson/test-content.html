Mad Libs is an <input type='text' placeholder='adjective'> game from the 1970s which allows players to insert random words in sentences driven by clues indicating part of speech.<p/>
The results are grammatically accurate sentences with maximum silliness.

<ul>This open source tool allows authors to generate customized html forms.
<li>Type into this first box of three.</li>
<li>View the results in html and browser output (windows 2 + 3).</li>
<li>Copy the html text when you are ready to paste and format it in a testMadLibs.html file.</li>
<li>This is a good tool to learn prior to learning about templating and/or forms.</li>
</ul>
